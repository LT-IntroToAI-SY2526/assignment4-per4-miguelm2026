# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

The hardest part was essnetially setting the game up itsel so that it would work accordingly. Like making sure that a user cannot input something on top of something that was already claimed, an dnot inputting something for numbers outside of 0-8. Getting the who won and game over also took some time to accurately represent which what was for which.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

I think something that I could do for this is add something to take over the part where a user as to input a number but rather the ocmputer would automatically input it?

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

I think something that I could do is make the computer read the entire board, analyze it and make predictions on what the opponet might do next. This would be benefiical to get you the best chance to actually win the game and make it harder for your opponet to lose.
